Similar to other viewer plugins (dataview, typeview), this plugin provides a ui endpoint for viewing and exploring samples.

A sample can be viewed at a url like `https://ci.kbase.us#samples/view/SAMPLEID/VERSION?`.

At the time of writing, the `SAMPLEID` is not yet determined.

Other endpoints may be available.
