ACOUSTIC_RANGING/GPS	Acoustic ranging from a GPS-navigated ship to identify the location of instrumentation on the seafloor.
DGPS	Differential GPS
DVL	Doppler Velocity Log
DVL/LBL	Real-time DVL dead-reckoning navigation supplemented with LBL navigation to help constrain fixes to a geographic coordinate system. Errors on the order of 10s (sometimes 100s) of meters are likely in these data.
DVL/LBL/INS	Real-time DVL dead-reckoning navigation supplemented with LBL navigation and INS (Inertial Navigation System) navigation.
DVL/LBL:Renav	Post-processed to merge DVL with LBL navigation. When combined with LBL navigation, precision depth measurements, and gyrocompass attitude data, DVL navigation can result in vehicle positioning accuracy ranging from <1 meter to 10s of meters depending on deployment geometry and conditions, and the nature of the post-processing [Kinsey and Whitcomb, 2004, 2006; Ferrini et al., 2005; Kinsey et al., 2006; Ferrini et al., 2007]. **Note that sample position information derived from this navigation product MUST be manually verified (e.g. with bottom photos) to ensure the success of navigational post-processing.**
DVL/LBL:Renav:Confirmed	Indicates that the DVL/LBL:Renav positions have been confirmed by human inspection.
DVL/USBL	Real-time DVL dead-reckoning navigation supplemented with USBL.
DVL/USBL/INS
DVL/USBL:Renav	Post-processed to merge Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) with Ultra-Short BaseLine (USBL) navigation.
DVL:Renav	DVL data post-processed to remove obvious errors in Doppler position data. Errors on the order of 10s of meters are likely to exist in these data and are due to the limitations of dead-reckoning navigation with DVL sonars. Users should refer to bottom photos to verify positioning information.
DVL:Renav:Confirmed	Indicates that the DVL:Renav positions have been confirmed by human inspection.
GLONASS	Global Navigation Satellite System
GPS	Global Positioning System
GPS/WireOut	Ship navigated with GPS, but instrument launched on a wire. Typically, a layback calculation is done to determine the precise instrument location.
GPS:Assumed	GPS was available and has been assumed to be the source of navigational information.
INS/DVL:Renav	Post-processed INS Inertial Navigation System (INS) navigation aided by Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) data.
LAYBACK	Layback navigation is typically calculated based on (1) the ship's GPS coordinates, (2) the amount of wire out to the towed platform, (3) the water depth of the platform (if available).
LAYBACK/LBL	Layback navigation supplemented with LBL
LAYBACK:Renav	LAYBACK navigation was used, but repositioning was done during post-processing, typically based on feature-matching.
LBL	Real-time Long BaseLine navigation [Hunt et al., 1974; Milne, 1983]. Utilizes travel times from acoustic transponders deployed near the seafloor to calculate positional information. Motion of the transponders, which are typically deployed on long tethers (up to 600 m in high relief terrain), result in motion of the reference frame, introducing positioning uncertainties on the order of meters.
LBL:Renav	Cleaned Long BaseLine (LBL) navigation data.
Locale	Position substituted from neighboring physiographic feature or deployed instrument.
LORAN	LOng RAnge Navigation
RTK GPS	Real-Time Kinematic GPS
USBL	Ultra-Short Baseline
